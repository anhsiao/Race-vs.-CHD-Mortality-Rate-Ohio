# Race-vs.-CHD-Mortality-Rate-Ohio
This project contains data concerning how race affects mortality rates in all of Ohio's counties and whether or not race plays a significant role in your chance of dying from CHD.
Using publicly available CDC Wonder data on CHD mortality rates, T-Tests were run on average mortality rates in Ohio comparing the white and black populations to determine whether their respective mortality rates due to CHD were significant.
